# clientServer

This is a simple Java chat programme that consists of client and server parts. With multithreading, the server may manage several client connections at once. Clients may establish a connection with the server, exchange messages, and carry out other operations including sending private messages, seeing who is online, and closing a conversation. Swing GUI components are used to construct the client interface, which offers a chat experience that is easy to use. This project serves as an example of Java GUI development, socket programming, and multithreading.

Features:
  Server-client architecture
  Multithreaded server to handle multiple clients simultaneously
  Private messaging functionality
  User status display
  Handling of client disconnections
  User-friendly GUI interface for clients
